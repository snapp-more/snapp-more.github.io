title: WORKING GROUP CODE OF CONDUCT
---

You can download the code of conduct policy (version 1) [here](link to pdf).

Our work and relationships are governed by a shared commitment to each other and our broader goals.

As a project funded under the SNAPP/TNC umbrella, we adhere to TNCâ€™s [Code of Conduct](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/accountability/code-of-conduct/) in terms of professional standards of conduct, and create a welcoming, inclusive, respectful, transparent, safe, and supportive environment. We expect that all members of the working group, the broad group of practitioners, data owners, and data contributors act in accordance with these core values. 

Because our working group stores, analyses and processes information regarding the monitoring of restoration projects, it is our responsibility to maintain the privacy of all data owners. More information regarding the policies we will follow regarding the management and privacy of data is available in our [data sharing policy](data_sharing_policy.md).
Plain language and a non-patronizing style in the appropriate local languages will be used to communicate to all working group participants and data owners.
Our working group is also responsible for ensuring the adequate protection of the rights and welfare of the people involved in our research. Therefore, when a project involves human participants, the University of Minnesota [Institutional Review Board](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb) will be followed.
New members can join the working group by reaching out to [snapp-more@umn.edu](mailto: snapp-more@umn.edu); this email account is managed by the PIs of the project. New members should explain the reasons why they want to join the working group. New members are welcome to participate in the projects that the working group is currently working on, and they could become co-authors in any of the products if they meet at least two of the criteria mentioned in the [co-authorship policy](co-authorship_policy.md).

Anyone violating this Code of Conduct will first be asked to cease these behaviors. Failure to comply with requests can result in escalating consequences which may include expulsion from the working group and exclusion of their names from working group products.

Please report any concerns to the working group PIs Jennifer Powers, Leland Werden and/or Laura Toro.
