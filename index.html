subtitle: Can long-term restoration outcomes be predicted from short-term data? How long should we track restoration projects to verify their success?

<p>The SNAPP-MORE (Monitoring Restoration) working group aims to answer these questions. We invite you to collaborate with us to answer this question. <strong>If you are conducting restoration in forests, savannas, and/or mangroves in the tropics, we request you to share your monitoring data with us.</strong>
</p></p>
We are collating datasets of <i>multifaceted (both ecological and socio-economic) outcomes of tropical restoration efforts,</i> and will analyze this database to answer the vital question: <i>Can we predict long-term restoration outcomes from shorter-term data?</i>
</p></p>
In this website, you will find detailed information about the <a href="about_the_project.md">project</a> and our <a href="about_the_team.md">working group</a>, the policies we are following (data sharing policy [insert link], co-authorship policy [insert link], code of conduct [insert link]). The draft datasheets using which we are collating monitoring data from practitioners like you are available here [insert link].
</p></p>  
Without well-planned monitoring, it is difficult to know the outcomes of the numerous existing and upcoming restoration projects. However, without knowing what the indicators are to monitor, and for long should these indicators be monitored for, it is difficult to plan for monitoring. Our working group, funded by the Science for Nature and People Partnership (SNAPP; a partnership of The Nature Conservancy and the Wildlife Conservation Society), aims to resolve this catch-22 situation.
